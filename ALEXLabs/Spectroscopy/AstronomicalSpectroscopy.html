      <h2>Identifying Spectral Lines </h2>

      <p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of why the Sun does what it does, let's take a step back and see what it
        does. In this experiment, you will see a mock stellar spectrum. You will notice that there are several
        wavelengths missing from this spectrum. As you learned in Astronomical Spectroscopy I, one of Kirchoff's Laws
        tells us about absorption spectra. The radiation from the Sun is one example of a place that we see these
        absorption lines in a continuous source. <br><br>

        The most conspicuous lines are called "Fraunhofer Lines" (named after the man who discovered and catalogued
        them). As Kirchoff showed, each of these lines corresponds to a different electron transition within atoms. Use
        the table in your lab manual and see if you can identify which line is which Fraunhofer line, as well as what
        element it corresponds to.

      <h2>The Blackbody</h2>

      <p>All bodies in the universe that have a non-zero (Kelvin) temperature emit radiation. We idealize this radiation
        with a concept called a perfect blackbody. How does the emission from a perfect blackbody vary with temperature?
        Let's find out.</p>

      <h2>Absorption Spectra</h2>

      <p>Why do we see the dark-line absorption features? <br><br>

        This all goes back to Kirchoff's Laws. We have a cool, gaseous source being backlit by a continuous spectrum.
        What the gas is made of determines the wavelengths that are absorbed. Let's examine this effect to see if we can
        identify some specific gasses.
